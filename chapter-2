Chapter 2

As they walked through the streets, a throng of young boys seeking adventure followed them, questioning them interminably.
Vibfar and Vorik found this rather funny, but the rest set to talking to them about their adventures with a rather
well-practiced air. Nierlon just sulked and skulked away. Vibfar's opinion of him crept downward, though his curiousity
remained unsated.

As they neared the edge of the city, Vibfar noticed an almost phantom-like creature following them. It was in the shape
of an old woman. Vibfar saw that her face was alike with Nierlon. Was it his sister? Mother? Aunt? He wondered at the
significance of this. Her face was gaunt, her trunk shrunk, her light feet reminding him of raindrops. Her hair was grey
as like to a pale puddle.

When the night started looming over them, and Vibfar thought it would be better to set up camp, they reached the border gate
that had historically shielded them from attacks from Trolls, Goblins, and other low bandits. Their badges shining in the
watch-fire, the guards checked their dogs and opened the gate.

This was it. There was no turning back. If he did, he would never get an opportunity like this again.

He resolutely strode forward, ahead of the rest of them, and did not look back.
