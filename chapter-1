Chapter 1

Menesthur, the Sun Mountain, gleamed bright in the sky, thought Vibfar. He had been sleepless, awake through
some horrible foreboding. Whether it should be an attack by Bob-knows-who on their town, or a sudden plague
or pestilence, Vibfar could not tell.

He decided that instead of aimlessly looking at the sun he'd do a little work. Vibfar was the son of Kuwirnolda Drunir,
a noble knight of the king's personal favorites. Thank Bob for that. Vibfar hoped to become a knight himself one day.

He stirred his now-cold cup of tea. He would have to reheat it. Not that he needed it, he was already quite awake.
He had read somewhere that humans needed rituals to function properly. Drinking tea was one of his rituals, as
constant as the ground he stood on and his family.

He was the envy of his friends in the village, due to being favoured enough to have meals straight from the royal
palace, while they had to make do with the local supermarket.

The palace. It would probably be time for a breakfast right now, since a long time, probably an hour, had passed
since Vibfar sat mulling and Menergunter raised his golden rays with Yisyuana, his divine consort.

He put his tea cup down (someone would find it sooner or later) and stretched his aching feet.
Walking out of the house, pausing only to snatch a piece of fruitcake on the kitchen platform, he made his way
to his father's accustomed haunt in the town guard hall.

Walking among the empty village stands, he felt the sense of foreboding grow stronger.
Pushing aside these thoughts he quickly made his way to the watch tower. His town was
a mountain-locked area, and you could only enter from the west through a high, steeped mountain pass,
closely guarded by the watch tower. The town was also on a plateau, so they enjoyed the frosty weather
year-round. The weather would make it difficult for enemies to lay siege to the watch tower, but they
had done it before, according to some old greybeards who still captivated the village with worn-out stories
at the fireside.

He rang the bell, and said his name out loud, as the doors opened before him. He met
the doorman with the traditional _arthugun_, placing his hand on his forehead, to show that the
other was in his head and not forgotten. The doorman did likewise.

He walked through the maze of hallways, leading to balconies that offered different vantage points,
depending on where the enemy was and where they were coming from. This was an important town as many
of the court lived here, close to the capital, Vithri, and yet afar from the daily hustle and bustle.

He met his father reclining in a chair, facing opposite the pass, looking at the village.
They chatted for a while, and then they heard a trumpet. Probably a usual alarm drill.

The scream, however, did not usually follow.

They ran towards the source of the noise, in the levels below, where they met in the fast-kindling
darkness - a Troll. In one stunningly quick move, he moved his great arm towards the newcomers, and
in one fell swoop threw Vibfara's father into the mountain face, a good ten strides away. The Troll,
however, could not do much more damage, and retreated against the new onslaught of the watch-tower's
archers. Vibfara ran towards his collapsed father. He was mumbling in a faraway voice, and his eyes
were rolled into the back of his head.

"Vibfaragunter."

"Your time has come. You will rid the world of a great darkness. You shall bring meaning and glory
to your name. You shall be like no other, yet you shall be overtaken by something completely
unlooked-for. Arth a'gunter drufaraquian nirxinold."

And he died.

***

"Kuwirunolda Drunir, lover of the Sea, guardian of the King's court, the renowned, is with us no more."

The pale man finished his epitaph and walked down the podium.

***

A year had gone by, uneventfully. The Troll had disappeared after killing his father, and something in
Vibfar's heart told him to stay and not pursue the dark creature. After a while, though, the king Menequian summoned
him and he was made a knight in his father's stead. This excited his friends greatly, but he accepted the
appointment with doubt - would he end up like his father?

The king had summoned him to the court, and had promptly started a discussion on the Troll and how it would
impact the relative peace that had lasted since their forefathers.
